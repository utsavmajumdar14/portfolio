    <i>Internship Project:</i><br>
    • Built a should-costing model for injection molding tools for the team to use on confluence workspace<br>
    • Validated and benchmarked the model and achieved less than 10% cost variance compared to existing quotations<br>
    • Built flexible UI focused on user-accessibility, transparency, and minimizing reliance on supplier information<br>
    • Automated the calculation and established standard operating procedures for sustained usage of model<br>
    <i>Cost Reduction:</i><br>
    • $17.2k savings across 5 injection molding tools using should-costing model<br>
    • Achieved a $1.06M annual saving by internalizing side view mirrors for Model Y and Model 3<br>
    • $3.9k saving on tooling cost for overmolded part in side-view mirror along with quality improvement<br>
    • Achieved annual saving of $125k on Cybertruck latch and $1.8M on future project through negotiation and design change<br>
    • Worked on sourcing, contract agreement, packaging improvement, and chargeback resolutions<br>
