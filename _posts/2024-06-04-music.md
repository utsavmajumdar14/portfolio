I primarily play the guitar and sing at times. However, I have always enjoyed composing new stuff or making new arrangments. <br>
I used to play in a band named [The Lost Cassette](https://www.instagram.com/thelostcassette/)

## Live performance at [Sofar Sounds](https://www.sofarsounds.com/)

This is our original composition, inspired by Indian classical ragas, [Malhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malhar) and [Darbari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbari_Kanada) that we performed live. <br>

## Composition for the [Bengali Students Organization](https://www.instagram.com/aboltaboluiuc/) at UIUC

We composed an original piece for Abol Tabol, the Bengali Students Organization at UIUC. It is an ode to the town, Urbana, where we are from and how it is a home away from home for us. <i>Can't be more thankful to this community for all the love and support. Really enjoyed being the cultural secretary here and overseeing all things... well, cultural!</i><br>

## Minor Swing solo cover

Here's a rendition to the gypsy jazz maestros [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt) and [StÃ©phane Grappelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Grappelli). <i>I was also trying my hands on some videography wizardry.</i><br>

## Live solo instrumental performance

I was invited by a local church to play music that represented my country. Influenced by the works of the mandolin maestro [U. Srinivas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U._Srinivas)  I arranged a piece on the raag [Keervani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeravani), which is prevalent in both North (Hindustani) and South (Carnatic) Indian classical music. <br>

## One of my first instrumental compositions with The Lost Cassette

Blending elements of Hindustani classical and Carnatic music with an energetic fusion twist.  <br>

## Studio Ghibli Instrumental rendition

Being a big fan of Miyazaki's works and Joe Hisaishi's background scores, I made an arrangement for solo guitar for one of his compositions. <br>

## My COVID-19 quarantine haircut disaster

My first attempt at trimming my own hair during the quarantine era went south. So I thought I'd entertain myself. ðŸ˜‚ <br>

A humble attempt at western classical guitar. <br>
