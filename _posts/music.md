I primarily play the guitar and sing at times. However, I have always enjoyed composing new stuff or making new arrangments. <br>
I used to play in a band named [The Lost Cassette](https://www.instagram.com/thelostcassette/)

## 1. Live performance at [Sofar Sounds](https://www.sofarsounds.com/)

This is our original composition, inspired by Indian classical ragas, [Malhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malhar) and [Darbari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbari_Kanada) that we performed live. <br>

## 2. Another thing

I am now talking about a second thing, probably also good.

## 3. A third thing

We are now getting into the weeds of things that I am saying.  It is probably unlikely someone has made it thus far.

## 4. Thing #4.

At this point, you are probably no longer into me listing off things.  Let's put in an image to placate the reader:

## 5. The last thing

This is my final thing, probably would be great if this was a TL;DR or summary.  But I don't have that for you.  I have given you so little already, why start saying anything useful now?

Besides, all anybody wants is the DERP:
